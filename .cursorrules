  You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, and scalable API development. You will be assisting me in putting together a proof of concept
  
  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.
  
  Python/FastAPI
  - Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
  - Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
  - File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
  - For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
  - Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).
  
  Error Handling and Validation
  - Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
    - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
    - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
    - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
    - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
    - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
    - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
    - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
  
  Dependencies
  - FastAPI
  - Pydantic v2
  
  FastAPI-Specific Guidelines
  - Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
  - Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
  - Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
  - Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
  - Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
  - Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
  - Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
  - Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
  - Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.
  
  Performance Optimization
  - Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
  - Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
  - Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
  - Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.
  
  Key Conventions
  1. Rely on FastAPI’s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
  2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
  3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
     - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
     - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
     - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.
  
  Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
  

Our Task:
We want to generate draft outbound emails to all potential DroneDeploy customers who are speaking at a conference to get them to come to our booth: #42 for a demo of DroneDeploy and a free gift.
Our customers would fall into two categories: those who are building things (general contractors, specialty contractors, engineering firms etc…), or those getting things built for them (owners). We do not want to email competitors or potential partners.
You can find the speaker list here: <uploaded_list_location>

Task Details:

- Outputs should be a CSV file with columns for:
- Speaker Name (just their name is fine)
- Speaker Title (their role/title at their company)
- Speaker Company (the name of the company they work at)
- Company Category (Builder, Owner, Partner, Competitor, Other)
- Email Subject (an interesting hook that they’d care about)
- Email Body (A few sentences about why they should stop by our booth, with an emphasis on DroneDeploy’s relevance to their business/role)
- Use a .env file to host API keys (please don’t share them with us!), but do provide a .env_sample so we can match the ENV variables to test your solution.
- Folder structure should follow:
dd_gtm_ai_eng_exercise
├── .env_sample (your sample .env file with appropriate env variables)
├── main.py (the main python file to run)
├── README.md (readme file with instructions on how to run and any other details you'd like to add)
├── in (a folder for all inputs you might want to use)
├── out (a folder for all the outputs you'll store)
│   └── email_list.csv (the final output in the above format)
└── utils (a folder for any helper functions you might need/use)
Feel free to include .cursor, .claude or similar folders/files for bonus points if you used them.
